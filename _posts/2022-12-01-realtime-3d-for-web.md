A series of small web-based experiments created using the Three.js library.
All geometry is constructed from basic primitive shapes provided by the library. The camera uses OrbitControls, allowing users to zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel and adjust the viewing angle by click-and-dragging with the left mouse button. Below are live embeds of some of those exercises.
 

## Snake Game

Only the first input within each 250 ms update cycle is registered. The source code can be viewed under [this link](https://github.com/kamilashi/Snake-Game).
