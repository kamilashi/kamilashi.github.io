This is a small practice project, started for the purpose of learning OpenGL and the basics of engine-less rendering. The idea of an endless jet flight as well as the stylized visuals was inspired by the incredible work of [Calder Moore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TI_qsgyXe4). For the current state of the source code please visit [this link.](https://github.com/kamilashi/OpenGL-Fun)

Currently, the terrain generation implements simple Fractal Brownian Motion and [height-gradient based erosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsJHzBTPG0Y&list=PLcyvXZtYpSWl_ZhC9r4OMtPv3H5ny13qf&index=72).

The jet model is a free [Sketchfab asset](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/free-fighter-jet-collection-low-poly-cb5966c988d9403895be89b364c2252f).
